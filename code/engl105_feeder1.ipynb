        "# Overview\n",
        "-   The purpose of these instructions is to give the context and tools to create two subsets relating to jail deaths in North Carolina divided by counties in Python.\n",
        "-   This will also allow you to eventually merge them together and analyze the data and variables pulled from the large dataset.\n",
        "-   All of the data is specifically from different counties in North Carolina.\n",

        "## Getting Started\n",
        "----\n",
        "1.  First, you will want to create a file in the file explorer to add all your work into.\n",
        "    \n",
        "-   The name of this folder is not important, as long as you know what it is. This step is important because you need to have all of your important files in one place so that nothing gets lost.\n",
        "2. Next, create a Google CoLab Notebook to begin creating your subsets. This is where all the coding will happen and this is where you will do the work of filtering and merging subsets.\n",
        "3. After creating your CoLab notebook, you should be ready to download the csv file into the notebook. You should begin by using  [this link](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/) to find the dataset called \"North Carolina\" and download the csv file they provide.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Do not download the pdf version, as the csv is what you will need to create your subsets in Google CoLab.  \n",
        "-   Once you complete the download, you should have a folder called \"North Carolina\" which includes a Microsoft Excel worksheet, and two csv files titled \"NorthCarolina_deaths.csv\" and \"NorthCarolina_jails.csv\".\n",
        "-   **You need to use the file titled \"NorthCarolina_deaths.csv\" in order to create this subset.** This is the csv file that has all the information needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Next, you will need to upload the North Carolina deaths csv file into the Google CoLab notebook. To do this, you should click the folder icon in the toolbar on the left of the Google CoLab notebook.\n",
        "-   Click the folder above \"sample data\" and then click the folder that says \"content\". Next, click the three dots that appears next to \"content\" when you hover your mouse and hit \"upload\".\n",
        "-   Once you have clicked upload, it will prompt you to add your csv file. This is where you will add the **\"NorthCarolina_deaths.csv\"** file.\n",

        "3. In the next bracket, you will need to input the specific columns that correspond to the variables that we need for this subset. The columns we want to look at our \"county\" and \"causes_detail\", as these columns will isolate the information relating to the county (which has already been specified by the numbers to only get Wake) and the causes of death for the inmates in this specific county.\n",
